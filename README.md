**Handwriting Recognition**
<br>
This is a keras convolutional neural network looking to automatically classify handwritten text
<br>
The aim of this was to explore CNN capability and to see the possibility of converting enterprise documents such as handwritten forms in to computer interpretable text

___
**Project Status**

Further developments will include english alphabet and automatic bounding box detection from documents

___
**Structure**

The .ipynb scripts contain the pre processing, training and validation and uses the keras library and python3 kernel
<br>
The .png incuded are handwritten digits that I have produced for testing purposes

___
**Data Sources**

The open data source comes from the MNIST database, preloaded within Keras and contains 70k examples of handwritten numerics
